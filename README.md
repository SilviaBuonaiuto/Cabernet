## Concordance Scores Significance

### BAF Correlation
#### Significance:

* 0.95: Samples from same individual
* 0.5-0.7: Parent-child relationship
* <0.3: Unrelated individuals


#### Interpretation: 
Measures similarity of B-allele frequency patterns, reflecting genotype concordance


### Mean Segment Concordance
#### Significance:

* 0.9: Samples from same individual
* 0.7-0.85: Related individuals
* <0.6: Unrelated individuals


#### Interpretation: 
Measures similarity of copy number variations/segmentation patterns

### Overall Concordance
#### Significance:

* 0.9: Samples from same individual
* 0.6-0.8: Related individuals
* <0.5: Unrelated individuals


#### Interpretation: 
Combined metric that balances genotype and structural concordance


### Concordance Quality Categories

* **Excellent (≥0.95):** Strong evidence of same individual with no mosaicism
* **Very Good (≥0.90):** Same individual with minimal differences
* **Good (≥0.85):** Same individual with possible minor mosaicism
* **Moderate (≥0.80):** Some discordance, possible significant mosaicism
* **Poor (≥0.70):** Major differences, likely significant mosaicism
* **Very Poor (<0.70):** Different individuals or major technical issues
